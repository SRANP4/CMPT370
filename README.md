- Using Standard JS
- Using ts-check and typings (but not using typescript)

- using typescript and eslint (still using standard JS)
- using this config for typescript and javascript linting using standardjs https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript#readme

# Model won't show up? 
The parser is very picky, try using blender to fix it 
    and fix scaling / off center models at the same time! =D

Skip 2 and 3 if the model shows up at the right size in the right location already
1. Import the model into blender (File->Import .obj)
2. Scale it down (select the object, scaling options will appear on the right hand side)
3. Center the model's geometry around the origin (top left beside View, Select, Add) click Object->Set Origin->Geometry to origin
4. File->Export the selected object as .obj
